Hello :D

This is Sidra Ali. I'm a dual major (Electrical Engineering & Computer Engineering).

### Project 1
I am taking CEG3310: Computer Organization this semester. When we have a major project in that class I'll update it here.

### Project 2
A personal project I'm working on is making a prosthetic arm. I'm planning on 3D printing the parts and connecting them to an Arduino Uno.
