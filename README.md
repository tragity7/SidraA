Hello :D

This is Sidra Ali. I'm a dual major (Electrical Engineering & Computer Engineering).

I am taking CEG3310: Computer Organization this semester. I haven't had any of its labs yet but when I do, I'll describe a project here.

Another project I'm going to be updating about here is more personal.
